# EcoBarterCalculator
A calculator hosted in GitHub to calculate how much each item "should" cost apply the "1 currency = 1 log = 5 rock = 4 ore = 1 sand/clay = 10 crop = 0.1 bison" rule

Currently using Python - Might change over to something like TypeScript to be useable in a browser via GitHub webhosting
